# Measuring Urban Service Access Across U.S. Cities

This project, developed as part of the NYU CUSP Urban Computing Skills Lab, evaluates how U.S. cities perform against the "15-minute city" framework — where residents should have access to essential services (parks, schools, retail, healthcare, transit) within walking distance.

## 📌 Key Objectives
- Construct a composite index of service accessibility using open urban data
- Normalize and compare scores across 100+ U.S. cities
- Identify spatial patterns and equity gaps using clustering and regression
- Explore implications for urban planning and data-driven policy

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Data cleaning, normalization, clustering (k-means)
- Visualization and exploratory analysis

## 📈 Key Insights
- Cities with high walkability and green space don't always perform well in transit access
- Spatial inequality in service access correlates with income and racial disparities
- Composite indices offer a simplified yet powerful lens for comparing urban performance

## 📊 Dataset
- U.S. Cities Urban Connectivity (Kaggle)
- ACS Socioeconomic Data (via census APIs or downloaded)

## 📍 Outcome
This analysis contributes to discussions on urban equity, sustainable design, and data-driven city planning. It also demonstrates core skills in data engineering, analysis, and urban informatics.
